Principal Component Analysis (PCA) serves multiple critical functions in
clustering analysis. First, it addresses the curse of dimensionality by
reducing the feature space while retaining the majority of variance in the
data. This reduction enhances computational efficiency and mitigates the
distance concentration problem inherent in high-dimensional spaces, where
distance metrics become less discriminative.

Second, PCA transforms potentially correlated features into orthogonal
principal components, eliminating multicollinearity issues that could
distort clustering results. The transformed features represent uncorrelated
directions of maximum variance, providing a more robust basis for identifying
distinct customer segments.

Third, dimensionality reduction improves cluster interpretability by focusing
on the most informative patterns in the data. By retaining 95.7% of
the total variance with 10 components (compared to 11 original
features), we achieve a parsimonious representation that facilitates both
algorithmic performance and human interpretation of the resulting segments.

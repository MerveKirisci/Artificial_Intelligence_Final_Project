The dataset comprises customer records from a retail banking institution,
containing 10,000 observations across 12 variables. The dataset
includes demographic characteristics (age, gender, country), account-related
features (tenure, balance, number of products), and behavioral indicators
(credit card ownership, active membership status, estimated salary). 
Additionally, a binary churn indicator is present, which will be excluded
from the clustering process to maintain the unsupervised nature of the
analysis, and will only be utilized in post-clustering interpretation.

The variables encompass both categorical (country, gender, credit_card,
active_member) and continuous (credit_score, age, tenure, balance,
products_number, estimated_salary) data types, necessitating appropriate
preprocessing techniques prior to clustering analysis.
